# Official Kali Linux Docker
This Kali Linux Docker image provides a minimal base install of the latest version of the Kali Linux Rolling Distribution.
There are no tools added to this image, so you will need to install them yourself.

# REQUIRES EXPERIMENTAL TO BE TURNED ON
Due to --squash being passed to the docker daemon, if experimental features
aren't turned on in your daemon, the build.sh script will fail.

On Kali, this is done via /etc/docker/daemon.json having the following contents:

```
{
    "experimental": true
}
```
